Documentation:


1.	Introduction:
Welcome to the documentation manual for the MySQL database schema used in our Airbnb-like platform. This manual is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of the database schema, including its tables, columns, relationships, and constraints. It is intended for developers, database administrators, and other stakeholders who need to understand how the database schema works and how to use it effectively. The manual includes detailed descriptions of each table, column, and constraint in the schema, as well as examples of how to use the database schema to perform common tasks. We hope this manual will serve as a helpful resource for anyone working with our reservation and payment processing platform.
